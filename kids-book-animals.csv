The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.""Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His""wonderful, awful""idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small.This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.Show more"

Madeline's Rescue,dog,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355323337i/773606.jpg,"It took Ludwig Bemelmans years to think of Madeline's next adventure after the 1939 originalMadeline, but he did it, and the result wasMadeline's Rescue, winner of the 1954 Caldecott Medal. One day on a walk through Paris (a ""twelve little girls in two straight lines"" kind of walk), Madeline slips and falls off a bridge right into the Seine. Everyone feared she would be dead, ""But for a dog / That kept its head,"" saving her from a ""watery grave."" What choice do Madeline and the girls have but to take the heroic pooch home, feed her biscuits, milk, and beef, and name her Genevieve? Sadly, when Lord Cucuface gets wind of the new dog, he decrees that no dogs will be allowed in the ""old house in Paris that was covered with vines,"" and kicks Genevieve out on the street. Madeline vows vengeance, and the girls scour Paris looking for the pup: ""They went looking high / and low / And every place a dog might go. / In every place they called her name / But no one answered to the same."" As we've come to expect from Bemelmans, all's well that ends well chez Clavel, and young readers will be tickled by this heartwarming, quirky dog story with a surprise finale.

Chanticleer and the Fox,fox,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386920782i/142033.jpg,"Adapted fromThe Canterbury TalesOne of the most delightful fables in our heritage is the story of the proud cock and the witty fox who flattered him. Chaucer told the story with vigorous rhythm and singing words; Barbara Cooney has adapted it for chidlren and illustrated it with pictures as handsome as a medieval herbal.Chanticleer was a merry rooster, ""His comb was redder than fine coral and turreted like a castle wall, his bill was black and shone like jet, and his feathers were like burnished gold."" He had seven hens, the fairest of which was Partlet.It was a great joy to hear them sing together. But one night a sorrowful event overtook them. A fox, tipped with black, and full of sly wickedness, burst through the hedge into the yard where Chanticleer and his wives were in the habit of going. The fox was clever, but he met his match in the rooster.Barbara Cooney's pictures are the most beautiful this gifted artist has ever drawn. Richness of color, strength of line and an abundance of color detail will attract children to them time after time and bring new delight to each reading.Show more"
